        receive and inspect the item. You will need to confirm if you want to
        keep or decline your product in maximum 5 days after you receive it. The
        item will arrive with all documents needed for registration and the
        title will be already signed by the seller. In this case, if you decide
        that you want to keep it, you will only need to register it under your
        name. If, by any reason you decide that you do not want to keep the
        product, you will need to contact us by phone to confirm. The{" "}
        <span style={{ color: "#1B7873" }}>Return process</span> will take up to
        12 hours, until our agents will take the item and the documents back
        from you. When our{" "}

        <span style={{ color: "#1B7873" }}>OfferUp Motors Representative</span>
        arrive at your location to take the item back from you, they will give
        you the money back in CASH. For security reasons the Bitcoin payment
        needs to be completed in person, with cash at the recommended store
        assigned for your transaction. In order to complete the payment, you
        will need the QR code found on your invoice, the cell phone, your
        personal ID and the amount in{" "}
        <span style={{ color: "#E74040" }}>CASH</span> for your purchase.
